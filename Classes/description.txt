[i]In the main menu of the game, select Custom Game, then you will see a list of all the mutators installed on your computer. Double click on the mutators you want in this list to add them to your goat.[/i]

[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]I got the idea of this mod after reading the description of the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=247267363]Goatbuild mod[/url]. When I was working on the APM, I discovered a really interesting function called SetBase() that attach an object to another object and I thought about a way to apply it to any object te be able to transport it.
So here is the result, I used the position of the Demonic Goat force field to attach the objects to the goat and allow to move them where you want ^^ I found in the code of the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=245365487]Baambs mod[/url] a nice way to throw items so I reused it for more fun.
I had a few problems with NPCs because they just didn't want to be grabbed, so I used the Tick() event to relocate them constantly at the correct position. InterpActors (moving objects) are even worst because every time you try to move them, they just teleport back to their intended position >_< All I could do was to stop them and make them moveable as a simple crate.[/quote]
